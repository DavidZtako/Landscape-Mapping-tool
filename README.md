## PROJECT DESCRIPTION (Ver 0.0.01)
This project is a landscape mapping tool analysising public transportation system based on Grasshopper of Rhinoceros. The main goal of this project is to develop a research pattern / Grasshopper battery compound which is able to test interactions of different parts of public transportation system (Eg: Subways-Bus interchange / Subways operated by different companies / etc). Data collected from Openstreetmap is the main data source using for developing the mapping tool. At this moment, the project mainly focus on the relationships in Tokyo railway transportation system, such as entrances density, lines and entrances from different operators, etc.  Meanwhile, mapping visulisition would be consistently discussed. Then other sites would be introduced to demenstrate the effectiveness of the project as the battery compound is finished.

## Build Status
If your project has some sort of automation server set up to run tests against the project's latest build, then it is a good idea to include an image in your repository showing the status of the latest build e.g. the top of this guide. See the *Useful Resources* section below for some links to documentation on how to do this with popular build tools.
